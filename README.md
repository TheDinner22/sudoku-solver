# Sudoku Solver
I want to make a program that can:  

    - Solve sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm  

    - Display a GUI of the Sudoku being solved using pygame  

    - Convert the 'solver program' into a sudoku game that can check you work and solve the puzzle for you at the press of a button  

    - Generate unique Sudoku puzzles (of varying difficulty) with only one solution  


# Sudoku Game
I plan to make the GUI/game board/window using pygame.

# Sudoku generator
Generating valid Sudoku puzzles that only have one solution is harder than it sounds.  
I plan to just grab puzzles off of the internet and implement this feature last.  
I found this pdf online: https://sites.math.washington.edu/~morrow/mcm/team2306.pdf

# Dependencies
- pygame, install it using "pip install pygame"
